# Project_F_tracking
Energy and Force based algorithm for identification of trivial crossings

Content of the repository:

`Exact` - exact calculations for reference, do them first;
          the results are used together with the TSH data, when plotting the results


`TSH` - the TSH (GFSH) calculations for different models and state tracking approaches.

`ADD` - the TSH (GFSH) calculations for additional model Hamiltonians (spin-boson)
